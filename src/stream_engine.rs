//! Stream Engine component.
//!
//! Responsible for pipeline management and execution.
//!
//! Stream engine has 2 executors:
//!
//! 1. Reactive executor
//! 2. Autonomous executor
//!
//! Reactive executor quickly changes some status of a pipeline. It does not deal with stream data (Row, to be precise).
//! Autonomous executor deals with stream data.
//!
//! Both reactive executor and autonomous executor instance run at a main thread, while autonomous executor has workers which run at different worker threads.
//! ```
